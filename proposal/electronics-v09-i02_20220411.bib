ABSTRACT = {Crowdsensing is an emerging paradigm of data aggregation, which has a pivotal role in data-driven applications. By leveraging the recruitment, a crowdsensing system collects a large amount of data from mobile devices at a low cost. The critical issues in the development of crowdsensing are platform security, privacy protection, and incentive. However, the existing centralized, platform-based approaches suffer from the single point of failure which may result in data leakage. Besides, few previous studies have addressed the considerations of both the economic incentive and data quality. In this paper, we propose a decentralized crowdsensing architecture based on blockchain technology which will help improve the attack resistance. Furthermore, we present a hybrid incentive mechanism, which integrates the data quality, reputation, and monetary factors to encourage participants to contribute their sensing data while discouraging malicious behaviors. The effectiveness our of proposed incentive model is verified through a combination of the theory of mechanism design. The performance analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed hybrid incentive model is a reliable and efficient mean to promote data security and incentivizing positive conduct on the crowdsensing application.},
